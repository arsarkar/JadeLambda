# Description
LambdaUtil is swiss-knife utility tool to kickstart lambda style functional programming in Java. Lambda-styled programaming syntaxes are partly supported by java from version 8.0 onwards. However, the monads for object and collection supplied by the factory are not complete. The functional interfaces lack error handling. Finally, it becomes impossible to write clean chain-like code by using the standard java library for functional programming. LambdaUtil is an extremely lightweight and barebone collections of monads and functional interfaces. Still, it allows developers to write clean chain-like code for mainly transforming data by performing a sequence of oeprations in a clean chain-like code block. As the exceptions are handled by the monad automatically, no messy try-catch block is necessary. In short, this tool may write your entire java program without using curly braces.
